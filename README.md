## Setup virtual environment Linux
A script for easy installation of the conda enviroments is included.
```bash
./setup.sh
```
The fastest way to obtain conda is to install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
Located usually under, e.g., 
```bash
/home/<user>/miniconda3/envs/sportyspice/bin/python3.6
```
set it in jour project settings (intellij) as existing conda environment 
(maybe you need to delete your .idea folder before to avoid intellij hickups).
